NOTES ON LODASH

Lodash
    A modern JS utility library delivering modularity, performance, and extras

_.defaults({ 'a': 1 }, { 'a': 3, 'b': 2 });
// → { 'a': 1, 'b': 2 }
_.partition([1, 2, 3, 4], n => n % 2);
// → [[1, 3], [2, 4]]

Lodash makes JS easier by taking the hassle out of working with arrays, numbers, objects, string, etc.

Best For:
    Iterating the above
    Manipulating and testing values
    Creating composite functions
